# US Federal — Financial AI Regulatory Guidance

**Authorities**: OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, CFPB, SEC
**Key Documents**: SR 11-7, ECOA/Regulation B, SEC AI Examination Priorities
**Status**: Active supervisory enforcement

## Overview

US federal financial regulators have applied existing supervisory frameworks
to AI and machine learning models at supervised institutions. Unlike the EU's
prescriptive approach, US financial AI regulation is principles-based and
enforced through examination and supervisory action.

## SR 11-7 / OCC 2011-12 — Model Risk Management

### Scope

SR 11-7 (Federal Reserve Board) and OCC Bulletin 2011-12 establish
expectations for model risk management at banking organisations. These apply
to AI/ML models regardless of complexity.

A "model" is defined broadly as: a quantitative method, system, or approach
that applies statistical, economic, financial, or mathematical theories,
techniques, and assumptions to process input data into quantitative estimates.

**AI models clearly fall within this definition.**

### Key Requirements

1. **Model Development and Implementation**
   - Document model purpose, design, methodology, and limitations
   - Validate data quality and relevance
   - Test model across expected range of inputs
   - Document assumptions and constraints

2. **Model Validation**
   - Must be performed by qualified staff independent from development
   - Three core elements: evaluation of conceptual soundness, ongoing
     monitoring, and outcomes analysis
   - Must assess model limitations and potential for misuse
   - Re-validate when models are materially changed

3. **Model Governance**
   - Board and senior management oversight
   - Model inventory and risk classification
   - Policies for model development, validation, and use
   - Change management procedures
   - Defined roles and responsibilities

4. **Ongoing Monitoring**
   - Track model performance over time
   - Compare outcomes to predictions
   - Monitor for degradation and drift
   - Trigger re-validation when performance thresholds are breached

## CFPB — Fair Lending and AI

### ECOA / Regulation B

The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and Regulation B prohibit
discrimination in credit decisions based on race, color, religion, national
origin, sex, marital status, age, receipt of public assistance, or
exercise of consumer rights.

### CFPB AI-Specific Guidance

The CFPB has clarified that:

1. **Adverse Action Reasons Must Be Specific**
   - When an AI model denies credit or offers less favourable terms,
     the creditor must provide specific reasons
   - "The computer said no" or "based on our algorithm" is insufficient
   - Reasons must meaningfully describe the principal factors
   - Model explainability techniques may be needed to generate accurate
     reason codes

2. **Disparate Impact Applies to AI**
   - AI credit models must be tested for disparate impact across protected
     classes
   - Even facially neutral features in AI models can proxy for protected
     characteristics
   - Creditors bear the burden of demonstrating business necessity for
     features that create disparate impact

3. **Documentation Requirements**
   - Document model development and feature selection process
   - Retain testing results for bias and fair lending compliance
   - Maintain records of adverse action reasons provided to applicants

## SEC — AI in Investment Advisory

### SEC AI Examination Priorities

The SEC has identified AI as an examination priority:

1. **Disclosure Obligations**
   - Investment advisers must disclose use of AI in portfolio management
   - Clients must be informed of AI's role in investment decisions
   - Material limitations of AI tools must be disclosed

2. **Conflicts of Interest**
   - AI tools that optimise for firm revenue over client interest create
     conflicts
   - Predictive data analytics that prioritise firm interests violate
     fiduciary duty
   - SEC has proposed rules on conflicts from predictive analytics

3. **Fiduciary Duty**
   - AI does not diminish an adviser's fiduciary duty
   - Advisers must understand AI tools they use
   - AI recommendations must be suitable for individual clients

### SEC AI in Trading

For algorithmic and AI-driven trading:
- Market manipulation through AI is prohibited
- AI trading systems must have appropriate risk controls
- Firms must maintain records of AI trading decisions

## Supervisory Approach

US financial regulators use a supervisory rather than prescriptive approach:
- Examiners assess AI practices during regular examinations
- Deficiencies result in Matters Requiring Attention (MRAs) or
  enforcement actions
- No pre-market approval required, but supervisory expectations
  must be met on an ongoing basis
- Interagency coordination on AI examination approaches
