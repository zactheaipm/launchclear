# US Federal — FTC Enforcement on AI Practices

**Authority**: Federal Trade Commission
**Legal Basis**: FTC Act Section 5 (15 U.S.C. § 45)
**Status**: Active enforcement

## Overview

The FTC uses its broad authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act to address
unfair or deceptive practices involving AI. The FTC does not have an
AI-specific statute but has actively pursued enforcement actions and issued
guidance applying existing consumer protection law to AI.

## Section 5 — Unfair or Deceptive Practices

### Deceptive Practices

A practice is deceptive if:
1. There is a representation, omission, or practice that is likely to mislead
2. The consumer is acting reasonably under the circumstances
3. The representation, omission, or practice is material

**AI Applications**:
- Making exaggerated or unsubstantiated claims about AI capabilities
- Failing to disclose AI involvement in decisions that consumers would
  expect to be made by humans
- Using AI to generate content that appears human-created without disclosure
- Deploying AI tools marketed as unbiased when they produce discriminatory
  outcomes

### Unfair Practices

A practice is unfair if:
1. It causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers
2. The injury is not reasonably avoidable by consumers
3. The injury is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or
   competition

**AI Applications**:
- AI-powered dynamic pricing that discriminates against protected groups
- Automated decisions that systematically deny services based on protected
  characteristics
- Collection and use of personal data through AI without adequate safeguards
- AI surveillance that causes substantial consumer harm

## FTC AI Enforcement Precedent

The FTC has brought actions against companies for:

- **False AI claims**: Marketing products as "AI-powered" when they relied
  primarily on human review
- **Algorithmic discrimination**: AI systems that produced biased outcomes
  against protected groups
- **Data practices**: Companies required to delete AI models trained on
  improperly collected data (algorithmic disgorgement)
- **Dark patterns in AI**: AI systems that manipulated consumer choices

## FTC Guidance for AI Companies

The FTC has published extensive guidance advising AI companies to:

1. Be truthful about what your AI can do
2. Tell consumers how you use their data for AI training
3. Make sure your AI actually works as claimed
4. Avoid using AI to discriminate
5. Consider whether your AI use is unfair to consumers
6. Disclose when consumers are interacting with AI
