# EEOC Guidance on AI in Employment Decisions

## Overview
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has issued guidance clarifying how existing federal anti-discrimination laws apply to employer use of AI and automated systems in employment decisions.

## Key Guidance Documents

### Technical Assistance: AI and Title VII (May 2023)
- Employers may violate Title VII when using AI tools that have a disparate impact on protected groups
- Liability applies even when the AI tool is designed or administered by a third-party vendor
- The "four-fifths rule" applies: if a selection rate for a protected group is less than four-fifths (80%) of the rate for the group with the highest selection rate, this is evidence of adverse impact
- Employers must demonstrate "business necessity" and that no less discriminatory alternative exists
- Applies to all aspects of employment: hiring, promotion, termination, compensation

### Technical Assistance: AI and the ADA (May 2022)
- AI tools that screen out individuals with disabilities may violate the ADA
- Examples include: personality tests, cognitive assessments, video interview analysis
- Employers must provide reasonable accommodations for applicants/employees when AI tools create barriers
- Health-related inquiries embedded in AI assessments may violate ADA pre-employment medical examination restrictions

## Practical Implications for AI Employment Tools
1. **Vendor liability does not shield employers**: If you use a third-party AI hiring tool, you are liable for its discriminatory effects
2. **Proactive testing required**: Best practice is to conduct disparate impact analysis before deployment
3. **Documentation**: Maintain records of testing methodology, results, and any remediation steps
4. **Selection rate analysis**: Calculate selection rates by race, sex, ethnicity, age, disability status
5. **Four-fifths rule**: If any group's selection rate is below 80% of the highest group's rate, investigate and remediate

## Enforcement Approach
The EEOC has signaled AI in employment as a strategic enforcement priority. Investigations have targeted:
- AI resume screening tools
- Automated interview scoring systems
- Algorithmic promotion/compensation tools
- AI-driven performance evaluation systems
