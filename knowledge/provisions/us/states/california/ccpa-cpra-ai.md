# California — CCPA/CPRA Automated Decision-Making Provisions

**Authority**: California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA)
**Legal Basis**: California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as amended by
the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) — Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.100-1798.199.100
**Status**: CCPA/CPRA in effect; CPPA rulemaking on automated decision-making
technology (ADMT) finalized 2025, enforcement active

## Overview

The CCPA, as significantly amended by CPRA (effective January 1, 2023), grants
California consumers broad rights over their personal information, including
specific provisions addressing automated decision-making technology (ADMT) and
profiling. The CPPA has promulgated detailed regulations on ADMT that impose
opt-out rights, access rights, and risk assessment obligations on businesses
that use AI and algorithmic systems to make significant decisions about consumers.

## Right to Opt-Out of Automated Decision-Making

### Consumer Opt-Out Right

Consumers have the right to opt out of a business's use of automated
decision-making technology, including profiling, when used to make **significant
decisions** concerning the consumer. Significant decisions include those that
produce legal effects or similarly significant effects regarding:
- Employment or employment opportunities
- Financial or lending services
- Housing
- Insurance
- Education enrollment or opportunity
- Healthcare services
- Access to essential goods or services

### Business Obligations on Opt-Out

When a consumer exercises their opt-out right, the business must:
- Cease using ADMT to make significant decisions about that consumer
- Provide an alternative process (e.g., human review) that does not rely
  solely on ADMT
- Respond to opt-out requests within 15 business days

## Right to Access Information About Automated Decisions

### Pre-Use Notice

Before using ADMT to make a significant decision, a business must provide
the consumer with:
- A meaningful description of the ADMT and its purpose
- The types of personal information used as inputs
- The output(s) produced by the ADMT
- How the output is used to make the significant decision
- Instructions for exercising the right to opt out

### Post-Decision Access

After a significant decision is made using ADMT, the consumer may request:
- The specific output of the ADMT for their decision
- An explanation of how the output contributed to the decision
- The logic used by the ADMT in plain language

## Risk Assessments for Automated Decision-Making

### When Required

Businesses that use ADMT to make significant decisions must conduct a risk
assessment before deploying or materially modifying the technology. Risk
assessments are also required for processing that presents significant risk
to consumer privacy, including:
- Large-scale profiling
- Use of sensitive personal information in ADMT
- Processing personal information of minors for ADMT purposes

### Risk Assessment Contents

The risk assessment must identify and weigh:
- The benefits of the processing to the business, consumer, and public
- The risks to consumer rights and freedoms, including risks of
  algorithmic discrimination
- Safeguards the business will implement to address identified risks
- Whether the benefits outweigh the risks after accounting for safeguards

Risk assessments must be submitted to the CPPA upon request.

## Data Minimization

Businesses using ADMT must limit personal information collection and processing
to what is reasonably necessary and proportionate for the purpose of the
automated decision. Collecting data beyond what the ADMT requires for its
stated purpose violates the data minimization principle.

## Enforcement and Penalties

- The CPPA has exclusive administrative enforcement authority for ADMT provisions
- Civil penalties: up to $2,500 per violation, $7,500 per intentional violation
  or violation involving a minor's personal information
- Consumers have a limited private right of action for data breaches
  (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.150) but not for ADMT-specific violations
