# California — SB 942 GenAI Transparency Act

**Authority**: California Legislature
**Legal Basis**: SB 942 — California Generative AI Transparency Act
(Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 22947-22947.8)
**Status**: Signed into law September 2024; operative January 1, 2026

## Overview

SB 942 requires covered providers of generative AI systems to implement
transparency measures including content provenance, watermarking of
AI-generated content, and making AI detection tools available. The law
targets large-scale generative AI providers and aims to enable the public
to distinguish AI-generated content from human-created content.

## Covered Providers

The law applies to **covered providers**: persons or entities that create,
own, or operate a generative AI system (or a product or service that
incorporates a generative AI system) that:
- Has over 1 million monthly users or visitors, OR
- Was trained using computing power above a threshold to be determined by
  regulation

Small businesses with fewer than 100 employees and below specified revenue
thresholds are exempt from certain requirements.

## Content Provenance Requirements

### Machine-Readable Disclosure

Covered providers must include or attach a **machine-readable disclosure**
in AI-generated content, including:
- A manifest or metadata identifying the content as AI-generated
- The name of the covered provider
- The date and time the content was generated
- A unique identifier for the content generation event

The disclosure must use an open, interoperable technical standard (such as
C2PA Content Credentials) where one exists.

### Latent Disclosure (Watermarking)

Covered providers must embed a **latent disclosure** in AI-generated content
that is not easily perceptible to humans but can be detected by technical
means. This applies to:
- AI-generated images
- AI-generated audio
- AI-generated video

Latent disclosures must be:
- Persistent through reasonable modifications (cropping, compression, etc.)
- Detectable using the provider's AI detection tool

## User-Facing Transparency

### User Notification

Covered providers must clearly and conspicuously inform users when they are
interacting with a generative AI system, including:
- That the system generates AI content
- That the content may not be accurate
- How to access the provider's AI detection tool

### Visible Labelling

When content is generated at the direction of a user, the provider must offer
the user the option to include a visible label indicating the content is
AI-generated. Providers must not allow users to remove or disable
machine-readable or latent disclosures.

## AI Detection Tool Requirement

Covered providers must make available, at no cost, an **AI detection tool**
that allows the public to:
- Upload or submit content to determine whether it was generated by the
  provider's generative AI system
- Access the machine-readable disclosure and latent disclosure information
  embedded in the content

The tool must be publicly accessible via the provider's website or API.

## Prohibitions

- Providers must not generate content with misleading provenance information
- Providers must not remove, disable, or materially alter disclosures embedded
  in AI-generated content by another covered provider
- Users who intentionally remove disclosures for purposes of fraud or deception
  may face liability under other applicable law

## Enforcement

- The California Attorney General has enforcement authority
- District attorneys and city attorneys may also bring actions
- No private right of action under SB 942 itself
- Violations are subject to injunctive relief and civil penalties

## Interaction with Other Laws

- SB 942 operates alongside CCPA/CPRA privacy protections — provenance
  metadata must not include personal information of end users beyond what
  is necessary for content attribution
- Federal preemption arguments may arise if federal AI transparency
  legislation is enacted
- SB 942 complements California deepfake laws (AB 730, AB 602) by providing
  technical infrastructure for content authentication
