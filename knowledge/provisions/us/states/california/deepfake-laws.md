# California — Deepfake Laws

**Authority**: California Legislature
**Legal Basis**: AB 730 (Elections Code § 20010), AB 602 (Civ. Code § 1708.86),
AB 1836 (Civ. Code § 3344.1)
**Status**: All enacted and in effect

## Overview

California has enacted multiple laws targeting the creation and distribution
of deepfakes and synthetic media, addressing three primary harms: election
interference through deceptive political deepfakes, non-consensual sexually
explicit deepfakes, and unauthorized use of a deceased person's digital
likeness. Together, these laws create one of the most comprehensive state-level
frameworks for deepfake regulation in the United States.

## AB 730 — Political Deepfakes Near Elections

### Prohibition

It is unlawful for any person, committee, or entity to knowingly distribute,
with actual malice, deceptive audio or visual media of a candidate for
elective office within **60 days** of an election in which the candidate
is on the ballot, with the intent to injure the candidate's reputation or
to deceive a voter.

### Definitions

- **Deceptive audio or visual media**: Audio or visual media that has been
  intentionally manipulated (including through AI) in a manner that would
  create a false impression that the depicted person said or did something
  they did not say or do, and a reasonable person would be unable to identify
  the media as manipulated
- Does not include satire, parody, or content clearly labelled as manipulated

### Remedies

- Injunctive relief: courts may issue temporary restraining orders to prevent
  distribution
- Civil damages: the depicted candidate may recover general and special damages
- Attorney's fees for the prevailing party

### Safe Harbors

- Satire and parody clearly identified as such
- Content with a clear and conspicuous disclosure stating it has been
  manipulated or generated by AI
- News reporting and commentary

## AB 602 — Non-Consensual Sexually Explicit Deepfakes

### Civil Liability

Any person depicted in sexually explicit material created through
digitization (including AI-generated deepfakes) may bring a civil action
against the person who either:
- Created the material knowing the depicted person did not consent, OR
- Knowingly disclosed or distributed the material knowing the depicted
  person did not consent

### Damages

- Economic and non-economic damages
- Punitive damages where appropriate
- Reasonable attorney's fees and costs
- Statutory damages of not less than $1,500 and not more than $30,000
  if actual damages are difficult to determine

### Scope

Applies to digitally altered or AI-generated images, video, and audio that
depict a real, identifiable person in sexually explicit conduct, regardless
of whether the depicted person is a public figure or private individual.

## AB 1836 — Posthumous Digital Replicas

### Protection of Deceased Persons' Likeness

Extends California's right of publicity (Civ. Code § 3344.1) to cover
**digital replicas** of deceased persons. A digital replica is a
computer-generated, highly realistic electronic representation of the
voice or visual likeness of a deceased individual created using AI or
other digital technology.

### Requirements

- Unauthorized use of a deceased person's digital replica for commercial
  purposes is actionable by the person's heirs, estate, or authorized
  representative
- Protection lasts for 70 years after the person's death
- Consent must be obtained from the individual (before death) or their
  estate/heirs for commercial use of a digital replica

### Exceptions

- Use in a news, public affairs, or sports broadcast or account
- Use in a play, book, magazine, musical composition, or work of fine art
  (provided it is not used as a commercial advertisement)
- Commentary, criticism, scholarship, satire, or parody

## Interaction with Federal Law

- No comprehensive federal deepfake law currently preempts these provisions
- Federal AI transparency proposals, if enacted, may interact with
  California's disclosure-based safe harbors
- Section 230 immunity may limit platform liability for third-party deepfake
  content, though California's laws primarily target creators and distributors
