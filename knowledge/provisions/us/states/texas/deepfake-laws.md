# Texas — Deepfake Laws

**Authority**: Texas Legislature
**Legal Basis**: TX Penal Code § 21.165 (sexually explicit deepfakes);
TX Election Code § 255.004 (election deepfakes)
**Status**: Both in effect; Texas was among the first US states to criminalize
deepfakes

## Overview

Texas was a pioneer in deepfake regulation, enacting laws targeting both
election-related deepfakes and non-consensual sexually explicit deepfakes.
Both provisions impose **criminal liability**, making Texas one of the
strictest US states for deepfake enforcement. These laws apply to any person
who creates or distributes qualifying deepfake content targeting Texas
residents or affecting Texas elections, regardless of where the content
was created.

## TX Election Code § 255.004 — Political Deepfakes

### Prohibition

A person commits an offense if the person, with the intent to injure a
candidate or influence the result of an election, creates and publishes a
**deep fake video** depicting a real person performing an action that did not
occur, within **30 days** of an election.

### Definition

A **deep fake video** is a video created with artificial intelligence that
would appear to a reasonable person to depict a real person performing an
action that did not actually occur.

### Criminal Penalties

- **Class A misdemeanor**: Up to one year in county jail and/or a fine of
  up to $4,000

### Elements

To establish a violation, the prosecution must show:
1. The person created a deep fake video depicting a real, identifiable person
2. The video was published within 30 days of an election
3. The person acted with intent to injure a candidate or influence the election
4. The depicted action did not actually occur
5. A reasonable person would believe the video depicted a real event

### Exceptions

- Content that includes a clear and conspicuous disclosure that the video
  is synthetic or AI-generated
- Satire and parody that a reasonable person would not mistake for authentic
  footage

## TX Penal Code § 21.165 — Non-Consensual Sexually Explicit Deepfakes

### Prohibition

A person commits an offense if the person, without the effective consent
of the depicted person, knowingly creates, distributes, or threatens to
distribute **fabricated intimate visual material** depicting a real,
identifiable person.

### Definition

**Fabricated intimate visual material** includes any visual material (image
or video) that:
- Was created or altered through digitization or any other means, including
  artificial intelligence
- Depicts a real, identifiable living person in a state of undress or
  engaged in sexual conduct
- Was created without the effective consent of the depicted person

### Criminal Penalties

- **State jail felony**: 180 days to 2 years in state jail and/or a fine
  of up to $10,000
- Enhanced penalties may apply if the material is distributed to cause harm
  or if the victim is a minor

### Elements

1. The material was created or altered using digital technology (including AI)
2. The material depicts a real, identifiable person
3. The material is sexually explicit in nature
4. The person did not consent to the creation or distribution
5. The defendant knew or should have known the material was fabricated

### No Consent Defense

Consent to appear in authentic intimate material does not constitute consent
to fabricated intimate visual material. Prior consensual intimate images
cannot be used to justify the creation of deepfake intimate content.

## Enforcement Considerations for AI Products

AI products that can generate realistic synthetic media of real persons may
trigger liability under these provisions if:
- The product is used to create election deepfakes targeting Texas elections
  (even if the product itself is not designed for this purpose)
- The product is used to create non-consensual intimate imagery of real,
  identifiable persons

### Risk Mitigation

AI companies deploying generative AI products capable of producing realistic
depictions of real persons should:
- Implement content safety filters that detect and prevent generation of
  non-consensual intimate imagery
- Include terms of service prohibiting use for election interference
- Consider watermarking and content provenance mechanisms to enable
  identification of AI-generated content
- Maintain logs of content generation requests to assist law enforcement
  investigations if required by warrant or subpoena
