# Illinois — Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act

**Authority**: Illinois Legislature
**Legal Basis**: Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act, 820 ILCS 42/1 et seq.
**Status**: In effect since January 1, 2020

## Overview

The Illinois Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act regulates employers
that use artificial intelligence to analyze video interviews submitted by
applicants for positions based in Illinois. It was the first US law specifically
addressing AI-powered hiring tools and imposes notice, consent, and data
deletion requirements on employers that use AI to evaluate video-recorded
interviews of job applicants.

## Applicability

The Act applies when **all** of the following conditions are met:
- An employer requests an applicant to submit a video interview
- The employer uses AI to analyze the applicant's video interview
- The AI analysis is used to determine whether the applicant is selected
  for an in-person interview
- The position is based in Illinois

## Notice and Consent Requirements

### Pre-Interview Notice

Before requesting a video interview that will be analyzed by AI, the employer
must:
1. **Notify** the applicant in writing that AI will be used to analyze the
   video interview
2. **Explain** to the applicant how the AI works and what general types of
   characteristics the AI evaluates

### Consent

The employer must obtain the applicant's **consent** to be evaluated by AI
before the video interview takes place. An applicant who does not consent
may not be penalized for refusing to participate in an AI-analyzed video
interview.

## Restrictions on Video Sharing

An employer may not share an applicant's video interview with any person
other than those whose expertise or technology is necessary to evaluate
the applicant. This prohibits:
- Sharing videos with other employers
- Sharing videos with third parties not involved in the hiring evaluation
- Using videos for purposes other than evaluating the applicant

## Deletion Upon Request

Upon an applicant's request, the employer must:
- **Delete** the applicant's video interview and all copies within **30 days**
  of the request
- Instruct any third party that received the video to also delete all copies

The employer must inform all applicants of their right to request deletion.

## Enforcement

- The Illinois Department of Labor has enforcement authority
- Violations constitute a civil offense
- Penalties: up to $500 for a first offense, up to $1,000 for each subsequent
  offense per affected applicant
- No private right of action under this Act (unlike BIPA)

## AI-Specific Implications

The Act directly regulates AI-powered hiring tools that analyze video content,
including systems that evaluate:
- Facial expressions and micro-expressions
- Vocal tone, pace, and speech patterns
- Word choice and language use
- Body language and nonverbal cues
- Any other characteristics derived from video analysis

Employers using AI-powered video interview platforms (e.g., HireVue, Pymetrics,
or similar tools) for Illinois-based positions must comply with these
requirements regardless of where the employer is headquartered.
