# NYC Local Law 144 — Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDT)

**Authority**: New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP)
**Legal Basis**: NYC Local Law 144 of 2021 (Int. 1894-2020), NYC Administrative
Code § 20-870 et seq.; DCWP Final Rules (6 RCNY § 5-300 et seq.)
**Status**: In effect since July 5, 2023; enforcement active

## Overview

NYC Local Law 144 is the first US law requiring **independent bias audits** of
automated employment decision tools (AEDTs). It applies to employers and
employment agencies in New York City that use AEDTs to screen candidates for
employment or employees for promotion. The law mandates annual bias audits,
public disclosure of audit results, and advance notice to candidates.

## AEDT Definition

An **automated employment decision tool** (AEDT) is any computational process,
derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or
artificial intelligence, that issues a simplified output, including a score,
classification, or recommendation, that is used to **substantially assist or
replace** discretionary decision-making for:
- **Hiring**: Screening candidates for employment
- **Promotion**: Screening employees for promotion within the city

### "Substantially Assist" Standard

An AEDT is used to "substantially assist" a decision when:
- The tool is used to overrule or modify a human decision, OR
- The tool is used as a weighted factor in a human decision, OR
- The tool is used to reduce a candidate pool from which a human makes a
  selection, OR
- A human relies on a simplified output of the tool to make a decision
  without considering other factors

An AEDT is NOT considered to substantially assist a decision if it does not
automate, support, or replace any portion of the discretionary decision-making
and is used solely to generate a candidate pool that is subject to independent
human evaluation.

## Bias Audit Requirements

### Annual Independent Bias Audit

Before use of an AEDT, and no more than one year prior to the use of the
tool, the employer or employment agency must ensure that the AEDT has been
the subject of a **bias audit** conducted by an **independent auditor**.

### Auditor Independence

The independent auditor must not be:
- Involved in the development or use of the AEDT
- An employee or agent of the employer/employment agency or the AEDT vendor
- Subject to direction from or financial interest in the employer or vendor
  that would create a conflict of interest

### Audit Methodology — Impact Ratio Testing

The bias audit must calculate the **selection rate** and **impact ratio** for
each category:

**Selection Rate**: The rate at which candidates in a category are selected
(screened in, scored above a threshold, or recommended) by the AEDT.

**Impact Ratio**: The selection rate for each category divided by the selection
rate for the most-selected category. An impact ratio below 0.80 (the 4/5ths
rule) indicates potential adverse impact.

Impact ratios must be calculated separately for:
- **Sex/gender categories**: Male, female, non-binary (where available)
- **Race/ethnicity categories**: Hispanic or Latino, White, Black or African
  American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Asian, American Indian
  or Alaska Native, Two or More Races
- **Intersectional categories**: Each combination of sex/gender and
  race/ethnicity (e.g., Hispanic female, White male, Black non-binary)

### Data Requirements

- The audit should use historical data from the employer's own use of the
  AEDT where available
- If insufficient historical data exists, test data or data from the vendor's
  other clients may be used (with appropriate disclosure)
- The source and demographic composition of the data used must be disclosed

## Candidate Notice Requirements

### 10-Day Advance Notice

Employers and employment agencies must notify candidates **at least 10
business days** before use of an AEDT. The notice must include:
- That an AEDT will be used in the assessment or evaluation
- The job qualifications and characteristics that the AEDT will assess
- Information about the data sources and type of data collected for the AEDT
- Instructions for how to request an alternative selection process or
  accommodation

### Notice Methods

Notice may be provided via:
- The job posting
- Direct communication to the candidate (email, letter)
- The employer's website (conspicuously posted)

## Public Disclosure of Audit Results

### Summary of Results

A summary of the most recent bias audit results must be made publicly
available on the employer's or employment agency's website. The summary
must include:
- The date of the audit
- The distribution (by sex/gender, race/ethnicity, and intersectional
  categories) of candidates assessed by the AEDT
- The selection rates and impact ratios for each category
- The source and type of data used in the audit

The summary must remain publicly available for at least 6 months after the
AEDT was last used for an employment decision.

## Data Retention

Employers must disclose their data retention policy for data collected by
the AEDT. Candidates have the right to know:
- What data the AEDT collects
- How long the data is retained
- Whether the data is shared with third parties

## Enforcement and Penalties

### DCWP Enforcement

The NYC Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) is the
enforcement authority. DCWP may:
- Investigate complaints from candidates
- Conduct audits and inspections
- Issue violations and penalties

### Penalties

- **First violation**: Civil penalty of $500
- **Each subsequent violation**: Civil penalty of $500 to $1,500

Each day an AEDT is used in violation of the law constitutes a separate
violation. Failure to provide notice to each candidate also constitutes
a separate violation per candidate.

### No Private Right of Action

Local Law 144 does not create a private right of action. However, candidates
may still bring claims under:
- Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (federal — disparate impact)
- New York State Human Rights Law
- New York City Human Rights Law
- Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidance on AI in hiring

## Interaction with Other Laws

- LL144 operates alongside federal anti-discrimination law (Title VII,
  ADEA, ADA) — a passing bias audit does not constitute a defense to federal
  discrimination claims
- New York State proposed AI regulation may expand obligations beyond NYC
- EEOC guidance on AI in employment (May 2023) applies independently
- The Colorado AI Act and Illinois AI Video Interview Act impose additional
  requirements for multi-state employers
