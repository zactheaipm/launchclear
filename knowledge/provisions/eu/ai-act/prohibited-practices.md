# EU AI Act — Prohibited AI Practices

**Law**: Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 (EU Artificial Intelligence Act)
**Article**: Article 5
**Effective**: 2 February 2025

## Overview

Article 5 establishes an absolute prohibition on certain AI practices that are
considered to pose an unacceptable risk to fundamental rights. These prohibitions
apply regardless of the provider's location, as long as the AI system is placed
on the market or used within the EU.

## Prohibited Practices

### 1. Subliminal, Manipulative, or Deceptive Techniques (Art. 5(1)(a))

AI systems that deploy subliminal techniques beyond a person's consciousness, or
purposefully manipulative or deceptive techniques, with the objective or effect
of materially distorting the behaviour of a person or group, in a manner that
causes or is reasonably likely to cause significant harm.

### 2. Exploitation of Vulnerabilities (Art. 5(1)(b))

AI systems that exploit vulnerabilities of a person or group due to their age,
disability, or a specific social or economic situation, with the objective or
effect of materially distorting their behaviour in a manner that causes or is
reasonably likely to cause significant harm.

### 3. Social Scoring (Art. 5(1)(c))

AI systems for the evaluation or classification of natural persons or groups
based on their social behaviour or known, inferred, or predicted personal or
personality characteristics, where the social score leads to detrimental or
unfavourable treatment that is:
- Unjustified or disproportionate to their social behaviour or its gravity, or
- In social contexts unrelated to the contexts in which the data was originally
  generated or collected.

### 4. Individual Criminal Offence Risk Assessment (Art. 5(1)(d))

AI systems that assess or predict the risk of a natural person committing a
criminal offence, based solely on the profiling of that person or on assessing
their personality traits and characteristics. This does not apply to AI systems
used to support human assessment based on objective, verifiable facts directly
linked to criminal activity.

### 5. Untargeted Facial Recognition Scraping (Art. 5(1)(e))

AI systems that create or expand facial recognition databases through untargeted
scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage.

### 6. Emotion Recognition in Workplace and Education (Art. 5(1)(f))

AI systems that infer emotions of a natural person in the areas of workplace
and educational institutions, except where the AI system is intended to be put
in place or into the market for medical or safety reasons.

### 7. Biometric Categorisation for Sensitive Attributes (Art. 5(1)(g))

AI systems that categorise natural persons individually based on their biometric
data to deduce or infer their race, political opinions, trade union membership,
religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, or sexual orientation. This does
not apply to labelling or filtering of lawfully acquired biometric datasets or
to biometric data categorisation by law enforcement.

### 8. Real-Time Remote Biometric Identification in Public Spaces (Art. 5(1)(h))

AI systems for real-time remote biometric identification in publicly accessible
spaces for law enforcement purposes, except in strictly necessary situations:
- Targeted search for victims of abduction, trafficking, or sexual exploitation,
  or search for missing persons
- Prevention of a specific, substantial, and imminent threat to life or a
  genuine and foreseeable terrorist threat
- Localisation or identification of a suspect for specific criminal offences
  punishable by a custodial sentence of at least four years

## Enforcement

Violations of Article 5 prohibitions carry the highest penalties under the EU
AI Act: administrative fines up to EUR 35 million or 7% of total worldwide
annual turnover, whichever is higher.
