# China — Algorithm Registration and Filing Requirements

**Authority**: Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC)
**Legal Basis**: Provisions on the Management of Algorithmic Recommendations
in Internet Information Services (互联网信息服务算法推荐管理规定);
Interim Measures for the Management of Generative AI Services;
Provisions on the Management of Deep Synthesis of Internet Information
Services
**Status**: Algorithm filing provisions effective March 1, 2022; extended
to generative AI and deep synthesis algorithms through subsequent regulations
**Official Filing Portal**: Internet Information Service Algorithm Filing
System (互联网信息服务算法备案系统)

## Overview

China operates a mandatory algorithm registration system administered by
the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC). Any provider of an internet
information service that uses algorithms with "public opinion properties"
or "social mobilization capabilities" must file the algorithm with the CAC
before providing services to the public. This requirement has been extended
to cover generative AI algorithms and deep synthesis algorithms through
subsequent regulations. The filing is not an approval process per se, but
failure to file is a regulatory violation carrying penalties.

## Who Must File

### Providers with Public Opinion Properties or Social Mobilization Capabilities

Under Article 24 of the Algorithm Recommendation Provisions, providers must
file if their algorithm-based information service has:

- **Public opinion properties** (舆论属性): The ability to influence public
  opinion through content recommendation, selection, ranking, or
  dissemination
- **Social mobilization capabilities** (社会动员能力): The ability to
  organise or mobilise social groups through algorithmic content
  distribution

### Generative AI Service Providers

Under Article 8 of the Interim Measures for Generative AI Services, all
providers of generative AI services available to the public must file their
generative AI algorithms with the CAC before providing services.

### Deep Synthesis Service Providers

Under the Provisions on the Management of Deep Synthesis, providers of deep
synthesis services (face generation, face replacement, voice synthesis, text
generation, scene generation) with public opinion properties or social
mobilization capabilities must file their algorithms.

## Filing Process

### Step 1 — Registration on Filing Portal

Providers must register an account on the CAC's Internet Information Service
Algorithm Filing System (https://beian.cac.gov.cn). Registration requires:

- Business licence or equivalent registration documents
- Contact information of the responsible person
- Basic organisational information

### Step 2 — Algorithm Information Submission

For each algorithm, providers must submit:

- **Algorithm name** (算法名称): The name used to identify the algorithm
- **Algorithm type** (算法类型): Classification such as recommendation,
  generation, synthesis, ranking, filtering, scheduling, or decision-making
- **Application domain** (应用领域): The domain in which the algorithm is
  deployed (e.g., news, e-commerce, social media, content generation)
- **Algorithm description** (算法描述): A description of the basic
  principles and mechanism of the algorithm
- **Intended purpose** (算法用途): How the algorithm is used in the
  information service
- **Algorithm self-assessment report** (算法自评估报告): A self-assessment
  of the algorithm's compliance with laws and regulations, including
  assessment of potential risks and mitigation measures

### Step 3 — CAC Review

The CAC reviews the filing within **30 working days** of receipt. The CAC
may:

- Accept the filing and issue a filing number
- Request supplementary materials
- Reject the filing with reasons

### Step 4 — Publication

Accepted filings are published on the CAC's public filing registry. As of
early 2026, over 300 algorithms have been publicly filed, including those
from Baidu (Ernie), Alibaba (Tongyi Qianwen), Tencent, ByteDance, and
other major providers.

## Information Required in the Self-Assessment Report

The self-assessment report is the most substantive component of the filing
and must address:

1. **Algorithm security** — potential security risks and mitigations
2. **Content compliance** — how the algorithm prevents generation or
   recommendation of prohibited content (as defined by the Cybersecurity
   Law, content regulations, and socialist core values requirements)
3. **Personal information protection** — how the algorithm handles personal
   data in compliance with PIPL
4. **User rights protection** — how user rights (opt-out, transparency,
   non-discrimination) are safeguarded
5. **Social impact assessment** — potential impact on public opinion, social
   order, and economic stability
6. **Anti-addiction measures** (for minors) — measures to prevent algorithmic
   addiction in minors, where applicable
7. **Fairness and non-discrimination** — measures to prevent algorithmic
   discrimination in service provision, pricing, or content distribution

## Ongoing Obligations After Filing

### Algorithm Changes

Providers must update their filing within **10 working days** when material
changes are made to a filed algorithm, including:

- Changes to the algorithm's basic principles or mechanism
- Changes to the algorithm's application domain or intended purpose
- Changes that could affect the algorithm's risk profile

### Annual Reporting

Filed algorithm providers must submit periodic reports to the CAC on the
algorithm's operation, including incident reports and complaint handling
data.

### De-Registration

When an algorithm-based information service is discontinued, the provider
must apply to cancel the algorithm filing within **20 working days**.

## Penalties for Non-Compliance

### Failure to File

Failure to file an algorithm that meets the filing threshold is a violation
under Article 31 of the Algorithm Recommendation Provisions:

- **Warning** and order to file within a specified deadline
- **Fine of RMB 10,000 to RMB 100,000** (approximately USD 1,400 to
  USD 14,000) for failure to rectify
- **Suspension of services** for continued non-compliance

### False or Misleading Filing

Providing false or misleading information in a filing may result in:

- Revocation of the filing
- Fines under the Cybersecurity Law
- Potential criminal liability for serious cases

## Practical Implications for AI Product Teams

1. **Determine filing obligation**: Assess whether your algorithm has
   public opinion properties or social mobilization capabilities. For
   generative AI services, filing is mandatory regardless.
2. **Prepare self-assessment report**: This is the most time-consuming
   element. Budget 4-8 weeks for a thorough assessment.
3. **Engage local counsel**: The filing process requires Chinese-language
   documentation and understanding of CAC expectations.
4. **Plan for 30-day review**: Factor the CAC review period into your
   launch timeline for the Chinese market.
5. **Maintain filing currency**: Establish internal processes to track
   algorithm changes that trigger re-filing obligations.
6. **Monitor published filings**: Review the CAC's public registry to
   understand precedent and filing patterns for similar services.
