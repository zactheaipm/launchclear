# Brazil Enforcement Precedents — AI & Data Protection

## ANPD Enforcement

### Telekall Infoservice — ANPD, 2023
- **Fine**: BRL 14,400 (~$2,900 USD)
- First-ever LGPD administrative sanction. Telekall offered WhatsApp contact lists of voters segmented by municipality for telemarketing/election campaigns. Processed personal data without legal basis and without appointing a Data Protection Officer. Small fine reflecting microenterprise status but landmark as ANPD's first use of sanctioning powers.

## Key Takeaways for AI Products

1. **ANPD is Active**: Despite being a relatively new authority (established 2020), ANPD demonstrated willingness to exercise sanctioning powers with the Telekall case. Enforcement is expected to increase.
2. **LGPD Automated Decision Rights**: LGPD Article 20 gives data subjects the right to request review of decisions made solely through automated processing. AI products must implement review mechanisms.
3. **AI Bill Pending**: Brazil's AI Bill (PL 2338/2023) includes specific provisions for foundation models and GenAI transparency. Once enacted, it will create additional enforcement grounds for AI-specific violations.
4. **Proportionate Fines**: LGPD fines can reach up to 2% of revenue (capped at BRL 50 million per violation). The small Telekall fine reflected the company's size, but large technology companies face significantly higher exposure.
5. **Training Data Disclosure**: The pending AI Bill requires transparency about training data for foundation models. Companies operating GenAI services in Brazil should prepare disclosure mechanisms.
6. **Cross-Jurisdictional Enforcement**: ANPD has cooperation agreements with other data protection authorities. Companies in violation may face coordinated enforcement across jurisdictions.
