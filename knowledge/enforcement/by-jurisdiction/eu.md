# EU Enforcement Precedents — AI & Data Protection

## GDPR Enforcement

### Clearview AI — CNIL (France), 2022
- **Fine**: EUR 20 million
- Biometric data scraping from public websites for facial recognition database without legal basis or consent. Ordered to cease processing and delete French residents' data.

### Clearview AI — Garante (Italy), 2022
- **Fine**: EUR 20 million
- Same biometric scraping practices. Garante banned further processing, ordered deletion of Italian residents' data, and required appointment of EU representative.

### Meta (Facebook) — DPC (Ireland), 2023
- **Fine**: EUR 1.2 billion (record GDPR fine)
- Transferring EU users' personal data to the US without adequate safeguards post-Schrems II. Ordered to suspend transatlantic data transfers.

### OpenAI (ChatGPT) — Garante (Italy), 2023
- **Fine**: Pending (temporary ban imposed)
- Temporary ban on ChatGPT for lack of legal basis for training data collection, no age verification, and inaccurate personal data generation. Ban lifted after corrective measures implemented.

### Amazon — CNPD (Luxembourg), 2021
- **Fine**: EUR 746 million

## Key Takeaways for AI Products

1. **Biometric AI**: Scraping publicly available images for biometric databases violates GDPR regardless of data being "public." Multiple DPAs enforce simultaneously.
2. **GenAI Training Data**: The ChatGPT ban signals that DPAs will scrutinize legal basis for training data collection, accuracy of outputs, and protection of minors.
3. **Cross-Border Transfers**: AI products sending EU personal data to non-adequate countries face existential regulatory risk (EUR 1.2B Meta fine).
4. **Employee AI**: Using AI/automated systems for employee monitoring or decision-making faces heightened scrutiny under GDPR Articles 9 and 88.
5. **Algorithmic Disgorgement**: Not yet applied in EU but the Clearview deletion orders (delete data AND cease using derived models) parallel US FTC approach.
