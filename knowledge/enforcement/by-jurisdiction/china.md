# China Enforcement Precedents — AI & Data Protection

## Data Security

### Didi Global — CAC, 2022
- **Fine**: RMB 8.026 billion (~$1.2 billion USD)
- Massive data security violations: illegal collection of clipboard data, facial recognition data, and precise location. Cross-border data transfers without security assessment. CEO and President each fined RMB 1 million personally. Largest data security fine in Chinese history.

## Algorithm & GenAI Regulation

### Algorithm Filing Enforcement — CAC, 2023
- **Penalty**: App removals, rectification orders
- CAC enforced algorithm filing requirements for recommendation, deep synthesis, and generative AI services. Multiple apps removed from app stores for non-compliance. Over 40 GenAI services approved after filing by end of 2023.

### Ant Group — Multi-regulator (PBOC, CBIRC, CSRC, SAFE), 2023
- **Fine**: RMB 7.123 billion (~$984 million USD)
- Multi-year rectification targeting AI-driven financial services including Sesame Credit (credit scoring algorithm) and Huabei/Jiebei (lending algorithms). Required restructuring as financial holding company with enhanced data governance and algorithm transparency.

## Key Takeaways for AI Products

1. **Algorithm Filing is Mandatory**: All recommendation, deep synthesis, and generative AI services operating in China must file algorithms with CAC. Non-compliance results in app removal.
2. **Cross-Border Data Transfers**: Transferring Chinese user data overseas triggers security assessments. Didi fine demonstrates severe consequences for non-compliance.
3. **GenAI Content Moderation**: CAC Interim Measures for GenAI Services require content review systems, training data legality verification, and AI-generated content labeling.
4. **Financial AI Governance**: Ant Group case shows Chinese regulators will restructure entire businesses over algorithmic governance concerns in financial services.
5. **Personal Liability**: Corporate officers face personal fines for data and AI governance failures (Didi CEO fined individually).
6. **Proactive Compliance Required**: China's regulatory approach is "file first, operate second." Products launching without filing face immediate enforcement.
