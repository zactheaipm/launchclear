## Key Takeaways for AI Products

1. **Algorithmic Disgorgement**: FTC requires deletion of AI models trained on improperly collected data (Everalbum, Kurbo). This is now standard FTC remedy.
2. **Facial Recognition**: Highest-risk AI application in the US. FTC bans, BIPA class actions ($650M), and state AG scrutiny.
3. **AI in Hiring**: EEOC actively investigating AI discrimination. NYC LL144 requires bias audits. Age, race, and gender discrimination claims likely to increase.
4. **Children's Data + AI**: FTC extends COPPA to AI models trained on children's data. Models must be destroyed, not just data deleted.
5. **State-Level Enforcement**: California CCPA, Illinois BIPA, and NYC LL144 create overlapping compliance obligations for AI products.
