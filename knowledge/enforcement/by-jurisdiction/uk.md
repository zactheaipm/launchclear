# UK Enforcement Precedents — AI & Data Protection

## ICO Enforcement

### Clearview AI — ICO, 2022
- **Fine**: GBP 7,552,800 (~$9.4 million USD)
- Scraped facial images of UK and worldwide internet users without consent to build biometric facial recognition database. No lawful basis, failed transparency requirements, no data retention limits. Ordered to stop processing UK residents' data and delete all UK data.

### British Airways — ICO, 2020
- **Fine**: GBP 20 million (reduced from initial GBP 183 million)
- 2018 data breach: website and mobile app compromised via supply-chain attack. ~400,000 customers' personal and payment data harvested. Insufficient security measures including lack of multi-factor authentication and inadequate automated monitoring/logging.

### Marriott International — ICO, 2020
- **Fine**: GBP 18.4 million (reduced from initial GBP 99 million)
- Data breach originating in Starwood Hotels' automated reservation database (acquired by Marriott). ~339 million guest records exposed globally. Unauthorized access to automated systems from 2014 undetected through acquisition and operations.

## Key Takeaways for AI Products

1. **Biometric AI**: ICO enforces against non-UK companies processing UK residents' biometric data. Clearview fine demonstrates extraterritorial reach.
2. **Security of Automated Systems**: BA and Marriott cases show ICO expects robust security monitoring, logging, and detection for automated systems processing personal data at scale.
3. **Acquisition Due Diligence**: Marriott case demonstrates that acquiring companies inherit data protection liabilities of automated systems in acquired entities.
4. **Fine Reductions**: ICO initial notices can be significantly reduced (BA: 183M to 20M; Marriott: 99M to 18.4M) through representations, mitigating factors, and economic circumstances.
5. **AISI and Frontier Models**: UK's AI safety approach is evolving from voluntary commitments (Frontier AI Safety Commitments, Bletchley Declaration) toward more formal expectations. AISI evaluations for frontier/foundation models will likely inform future enforcement.
6. **FCA for Financial AI**: Financial services firms using AI face FCA oversight under existing principles (treating customers fairly, systems and controls). AI-specific enforcement actions expected as FCA AI guidance matures.
7. **Pro-Innovation Approach**: UK regulatory approach is less prescriptive than EU but ICO enforcement on data protection is robust. AI-specific enforcement will build on existing UK GDPR foundations.
